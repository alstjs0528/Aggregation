# Aggregation
Protein aggregation is the phenomenon which occurs when misfolded or unfolded protein physically binds together and can cause the development of various amyloidosis diseases. The goal of this study was to construct surrogate models for predicting protein aggregation using data-driven methods with two types of databases. First, an aggregation propensity score database was constructed by calculating scores for protein structures in Protein Data Bank using Aggrescan3D 2.0. Second, for the experimental data, a feature-based model was built using Curated Protein Aggregation Database 2.0 to predict the aggregated intensity curves. In summary, this study suggests which approaches is more effective to predict protein aggregation depending on types of descriptors and database.
